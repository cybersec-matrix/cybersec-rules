## Rules

1. **Don't be a dick**
    * Do not insult others, stir shit, or fuel flame wars
    * Gray areas are decided by the moderation team
2. **Quality > Quantity**
    * Keep discussion focused around information security
    * Try to avoid writing 3 messages in a row; each with less than 5 words.
    * There's no need for rooms to be active 24 hours per day: Inactivity isn't an excuse for off-topic spam.
3. **Use the off-topic**
    * Rules are significantly less strict here
    * If a mod asks you to move a discussion to the off-topic, move it
4. **Plz no post:**

    2. Room shilling (DMs mods first)
    3. Racism/sexism/yadda/yadda/yadda
    4. Porn/gore
    5. Warez/hacked data/PII
5. **Use English**
6. **For feedback or mute/ban repeals**
    * Use the off-topic, or DM one, or many, of the mods
