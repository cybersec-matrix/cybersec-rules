# Cybersec Rules page

Could be more. Made with [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on IPFS via [Fleek](https://fleek.co/).

## Just want to changes the rules?

Make a PR to `index.md`.
To add a new page at `/page/`, add a `/page.md`: Try to copy-paste `index.md` for formatting initially.

## How to test locally?
```
git clone https://github.com/cybersec-matrix/cybersec-rules
cd cybersec-rules
npm start
```
